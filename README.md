### Hi there 👋

My name is Alekz. I'm a lab technician by day 🌞 and a web developer by night. 🌝 <br>
🔭 I’m currently working on my portfolio website while making my way through the front end development pathways on Free Code Camp and The Odin Project. <br>

Here is a random joke that'll make you laugh!
